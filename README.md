# Flashcard-Generator

This is useful app for building flash cards for educational purpose that forces users to remember the important part of a sentence.

This app uses backend for a basic flashcard application.

(The backend constitutes an API that allows us to create two types of flashcards.)

Basic flashcards have a front ("What is the capital of Argentina? "), and a back ("Buenos Aires") properties.

Onn the other side, Cloze-Deleted flashcards present partial text ("... is the capital of Belgium ") - partial property, and the cloze text ("Brussels") - cloze property.
